# Energy-Matrix
This project is to meant to spread awareness about the lack of energy sources we will have within the next 50 years.
This program asks you to rank 12 attributes in order of importance to you. Then, it will give you commentary about which energy sources fit your values and if these will be sustainable sources in the future.

I constructed the scoring algorithm to evaluate energy sources based on user-defined attributes, providing insights into
environmental impact and projected availability.
